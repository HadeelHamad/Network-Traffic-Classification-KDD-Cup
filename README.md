## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Nowadays, in the digital world, the field of cybersecurity has became more important, and the need of anomaly-detection real time systems has extremely increased. These systems can allow the ability to perform fast real-time defensive operations to protect the cyber world. This project is to build a classifier that can detect network intrusions by classifying network connections to “normal” or “attack” classes. This predictive model will be helpful to the field of network security as an automated network intrusion detector. Classifying connection’s types accurately via machine
learning models would enable the Security Operations Center (SOC) officials to prevent malicious events efficiently and can allow to perform fast real-time defensive operations to protect the cyber world.

## Libraries <a name="installation"></a>
The code should run using Python 3, and it is designed as Jupyter Notebook so Anaconda distribution of Python shall run the code successfully. The following lised libraries need to be installed.

- 	Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- 	Scikit-learn for building the classification models and their evaluation.
- 	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- 	Keras for building neural networks.
- 	Imblearn for under-sampling the data


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to show work done in this project as the primary code file. The notebook is provided with many Markdown cells to describe some headlines or comments. 
 
There is also a `.zip` file which is the dataset used for this project, and it shall be unzipped before running the code file.

The '.pdf' file is the technical report that describes all implemented details 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the Results section of the technical report, it is available [here](https://github.com/HadeelHamad/Network-Traffic-Classification-KDD-Cup-/blob/master/Project%20technical%20report.pdf).
